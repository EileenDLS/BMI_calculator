# BMI_calculator
Write a JavaFX application that will calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) for people. 
It must be able to accept as input weights (in pounds or kilos), and height (in inches or centimeters). 
The application should have a calculate button, and should display the result as well as if the data puts the person in one of 4 categories: 
underweight ( BMI < 18.5) , normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0 - 29.9) or overweight (BMI > 30)
